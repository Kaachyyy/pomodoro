# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a timer based on the famous Pomodoro technique, which helps you divide your time into three parts: Pomodoro (work session), short break, and long break. I developed this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an aesthetically pleasing experience for managing your time. The website features aura-themed assets made using Canva.

You can personalize the background (aura) to suit your preferences and set your own durations for work and break sessions.
